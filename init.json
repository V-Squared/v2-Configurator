They are easy to set up, easy to use, small build and beautiful design to not upset the living room atmosphere. But they are also a closed system. In case you are (or becoming) a technical person you may be already hitting against these limitations. This is where the ViCase Gaming PC comes in. It takes the small size and beautiful looks of the Gaming Consoles, but it is an open system, inviting you to expand it in any direction you please. Once you get your ViCase Gaming PC to work, you will be rewarded with significantly better gaming graphics and higher FPS."

Depending on the game you are playing you may experience same speed or it may be noticeably slower. If you play on Ubuntu, you would buy your games on Steam. The biggest draw back is that not all game titles are available on Linux. 2) Windows 10 is the save choice. All titles available and best GPU drivers. Only drawback is that it will set you back $100 US. So you always can start with Ubuntu, invest the $100 into 3 games that play on it and upgrade to Windows 10 later. 3) SteamOS will be a game changer. Pun intended. One day in the future GPUs under SteamOS will have same FPS than under Windows. And all Titles will be available under SteamOS too. Today - however - SteamOS is in beta. It has one thing going for it that is the support of its cool game pad. 4) You can of course install more than one OS and enjoy the different strengths of each."

Heck, even the ATX cables are so big. The ATX cables alone fill the ViCase housing leaving no space for anything else. The solution are Pico ATX Power Supplies. The power supply itself is made tiny by using modern, high efficiency, high density (read expensive) power circuits. And the space consuming cables are done away completely, by soldering the power supply PCB directly to the ATX connector. Problem solved. Unfortunately you now need two Power Supplies: 1) AC/DC Adapter 2) Pico ATX Power aka ViCase-Power. This makes the power supply of the Mini Computer more expensive versus a standard Desktop. In turn you get a much smaller and much more quiet PC."

Until then, you will need to buy a ViCase-Power with us, because it is custom made to fit the ViCase and its IO Panel."

This puts you at the risk that by the time you buy a new computer, it will have another connector and you are forced to buy a new PCIe Expansion Box as well. Instead all V² cables have one standardized V²C.Micro connector, compatible with all V² Expansion products, such as ViDock. Using the different V²Cables and V² Adapters you can connect to: PCI Express (TM), Mini PCI Express (TM), ExpressCard (TM), Thunderbolt (TM), V²C.Nano (TM), V²C.Mini (TM), V²C.Card (TM). Support for more connections such as WiGig is in development. This means if your next computer has a different connector, all you need to do is to buy a different V² Cable or Adapter and you can keep your PCIe Expansion Box / Docking Station."

The lowest Intel CPU choice is 35 W. But since the Motherboard chip is integrated in AMD AM1 and not integrated in Intel CPUs your power consumption comparison is 12 W versus 48W. Keep in mind though that maximum performance of Entry AMD line is limited to about the performance level of a tablet. In some countries Entry AMD is half the cost for motherboard and CPU when compared to Entry Intel. In other countries the cost is the same. This motherboard directly supports UHD = 4k Display. Only at 30 Hz, but will be sufficient for high end picture frame. Paired with ViCase Tiny you get a Mini or All-In-One PC of lowest cost, lowest power consumption with good looks. Using standard Desktop components will allow you to upgrade only parts when needed and keep it operational for decades to come. The very low power consumption allows for passive cooling and makes this PC practically maintenance free."

Ideal for a general purpose low cost PC or for a presentation PC, such as a large size 28\" picture frame to replace an A2 printer or presentation displays in meeting rooms, lobby, hotels, etc. The very low power consumption allows the use of a passive cooler, which makes this PC completely maintenance free and literally silent when paired with an SSD. Performance will feel like a decent tablet. Recommended OS Ubuntu. It also may serve as a streaming PC for Gaming or Video. Be aware that in some countries an Intel Celeron CPU is lower cost and at the same time faster."

This CPU will give you a very snappy Office / General Purpose PC. The power budget is still very small with 25W in total, which leads to additional savings in power supply and CPU cooler. Bear in mind that this is the fastest CPU that you can plug into the Entry Motherboard. If you plan on growing the performance of your PC, then you will be better served with the Mid Range Motherboard. But if you are looking for lowest cost, low power consumption HTPC / Office PC, this is the best value — with quite a margin."

This CPU uses the same LGA 1150 socket. This means you can replace this CPU at a later time even with an i5 or i7 Quad Core. Enough room to grow.

Instead of going all the way to an i7 Quad Core you often get higher performance for your money by investing into a PCIe Add In Card of the type corresponding to your application. The i5-6500 CPU comes with the newly released LGA 1151 socket with the key benefit to support DDR4. DDR4 memory clock starts today at 2133 MHz, versus 1600 MHz of DDR3. Yet you will not see today faster memory transfer rates in real life. This is because the CAS timing is more relaxed as with DDR3 memory. Surely this will change in the future. However, there is one benefit that you can enjoy instantly. DDR4 will allow in an ITX motherboard 32 GB, whereas DDR3 will max out at 16 GB!"

High Profile Modules may collide with the Cooler-L, depending on your Motherboard layout. As always, if you do not want to be troubled with such details, use the Wizard of the V²Configurator. All our ready made configurations using High Profile Memory Modules use the ViCase-Cooler-XL to ensure conflict free assembly for you. Its more expensive design based on heat pipes allows for larger memory modules. To make life simple, all DDR3 memory modules we selected are Low Profile and all DDR4 Modules are High Profile. This makes for straight forward paring: DDR3 with ViCase-Cooler-L and DDR4 with ViCase-Cooler-XL."

The difference is vibration, which will significantly shorten the lifespan of a Disk. RAID drives are designed to higher specs to avoid vibration in the first place and higher class RAID drives even have active vibration cancellation. Also desktop may be recognized as bad even when they are still good when used in a RAID due to different time out standards of desktop drives versus RAID drives. In shorty. do NOT use desktop drives in a RAID. If you are on budget, Western Digital RED are about the same cost as quality desktop drives and they work beautifully in RAID."

Having a separate case for the GPU has the advantage of a much better airflow design, keeping all your PC parts cooler to prevent premature aging and at the same time keeping your PC more quiet versus a single case Desktop. ViCase + ViDock is a two case solution that is smaller, quieter, cooler and more modular versus a single case desktop."

One step safer is to use a RAID5 system in your workstation -- such as ViCase-Ultra -- and make sequential backups on your NAS. And the highest level of safety is to have two NAS in two locations. So if one location is lost, be it by thief or higher force, then you still have your data safe in another location. A Synologyt NAS is very simple to setup. If your Data is important you should keep it safe. Life happens. Give yourself peace of mind."
