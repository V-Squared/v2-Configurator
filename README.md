## Purpose of gh-pages branch

### Currently our nightly-build branch
All development happens on Forks on Developer's Repository. Every evening (China time) we check for Pull-Requests. When present we will merge them into this branch. As such this branch doubles as our current nightly-build branch. As soon as we have a stable release v0.2, we will add a release and nightly build branch. Once we will work on a v0.3 release we will add a candidate branch.

### Hosts our Demo Version
The code of this branch automatically makes for → [Demo of V²Configurator on GitHub Pages](http://v-squared.github.io/v2-Configurator/). This is why the name of this branch is gh-page, as in short for [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
